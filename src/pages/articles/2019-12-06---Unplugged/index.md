## Why I Quit
I used to spend upwards of 5 hours/day on my phone. Mind you, this was when I was finishing my undergraduate degree. My time was spent in these communities:
* [Reddit](https://reddit.com/) 
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
* [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

Ultimately, this left me incredibly unproductive and overstimulated. This habit carried over to my graduate job - a Cloud Engineer at Elanco. Starting the role, I had no time during the day to waste time: Implementing the infrastructure for a startup with a recent $7bn acquisition keeps you on your toes. 

Outside of work, I didn't mind where I spent my time; There were no exams to prep for or coursework to complete. 

My time was spent reading comments on Hacker News/Lobsters, however my kryptonite was Reddit on [/r/all](https://reddit.com/r/all).

Overstimulation kills imagination. I couldn't think for myself. The quick hits of dopamine from the infinite flow of images, the memes and comments upon comments in threads on different topics killed it.

With no imagination, my head was clogged. I couldn't think in meetings in a workplace where there is a culture of meetings. I couldn't solution in a roles that requires solutions. I couldn't even maintain a conversation without forgetting what I was on about half way through. 

## How I Did It
I had to stop. Reddit was taking up the most of my time and threads on HN/Lobsters were to go too. YouTube was fine though; it was my only form of entertainment at home. When I moved out, I never had a cord to cut.

I've killed this habit before, which is why I know it works. Content is, without a doubt, an addiction. 

I've tried weening myself off. That didn't work. I've tried using apps with worse user experiences. That didn't work either. I tried quitting cold turkey. That worked. It was difficult. But it worked.

I decided that if I could do 3 weeks without any of this overstimulation, I could do it. I could keep unplugged. I started off by removing Apollo from my iPhone. Apollo provides an excellent UX for reddit (where the native app, and their redesign fails). Apollo provides such a good UX that it was difficult to quit and keep the app on my phone for "news".

The first week was dreadful. I was in a cycle of unlocking my phone, swiping to where Apollo once was and locking it. I couldn't hit comments on any of my news apps either. I'd say that those short, sweet comments lead to another burst of dopamine.

Going in to the second week, I was reading more news, reading everything that those news sources had to offer. It was at this point, my attention span began to increase. I started sleeping easier. I wake at 0600, so getting up also became a breeze.

After the third week, it became easy to just read whatever I wanted on Hacker News. My attention span was back and in full force. I noticed this elsewhere too. I spent less time multi-tasking focusing on just cooking, or what was on the TV, or speaking with my other half. Food got better, entertainment got more entertaining and my relationship improved.

## Why I Came Back
I had an issue. I had mental clarity, but felt as though I was falling out of date. I had no f*cking idea what was going on in the world. To me, that's not a huge issue, but it also brought up that I was falling out of date in the web space. My passtime, as well as my placement year at Eli Lilly, is web development. It's why I picked the shiney Gatsby blog over some Wordpress bullshit.

Again, my reason for going offline was because I didn't want to fall behind in my career. I was also a bit bored. I had to come back. I am back. It doesn't feel like a waste though. It was a good experience. I fixed a lot of my issues with my mind. 

Since I started this article, I've gone full overstimulation mode again. This marks the end of that. Going totally away from Reddit and discussion on HN/Lobsters just left me bored. This next iteration, or sprint, marks the self-control chapter. 

My goals for this sprint are:
* Keep Apollo on my phone, staying away from /r/all
  * Currently, I sit with an average of 7 hours of screen-time a week. I want to see this go down to 4
* Keep up to date with current affairs
* Keep up to date with the latest in web
* Keep on exploring my hobbies
  * Release Blog V2
  * Release my second Express clone
  * Learn more about WebRTC; implement some distributed datastore (please don't be [another blockchain](https://github.com/hjfitz/pow-and-pos-blockchain))
