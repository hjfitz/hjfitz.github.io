Mind you, this was when I was finishing my undergraduate degree. My time was spent in these communities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reddit.com/\">Reddit</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lobste.rs\">lobste.rs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, this left me incredibly unproductive and overstimulated. This habit carried over to my graduate job - a Cloud Engineer at Elanco. Starting the role, I had no time during the day to waste time: Implementing the infrastructure for a startup with a recent $7bn acquisition keeps you on your toes. </p>\n<p>Outside of work, I didn’t mind where I spent my time; There were no exams to prep for or coursework to complete. </p>\n<p>My time was spent reading comments on Hacker News/Lobsters, however my kryptonite was Reddit on <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/all\">/r/all</a>.</p>\n<p>Overstimulation kills imagination. I couldn’t think for myself. The quick hits of dopamine from the infinite flow of images, the memes and comments upon comments in threads on different topics killed it.</p>\n<p>With no imagination, my head was clogged. I couldn’t think in meetings in a workplace where there is a culture of meetings. I couldn’t solution in a roles that requires solutions. I couldn’t even maintain a conversation without forgetting what I was on about half way through. </p>\n<h2>How I Did It</h2>\n<p>I had to stop. Reddit was taking up the most of my time and threads on HN/Lobsters were to go too. YouTube was fine though; it was my only form of entertainment at home. When I moved out, I never had a cord to cut.</p>\n<p>I’ve killed this habit before, which is why I know it works. Content is, without a doubt, an addiction. </p>\n<p>I’ve tried weening myself off. That didn’t work. I’ve tried using apps with worse user experiences. That didn’t work either. I tried quitting cold turkey. That worked. It was difficult. But it worked.</p>\n<p>I decided that if I could do 3 weeks without any of this overstimulation, I could do it. I could keep unplugged. I started off by removing Apollo from my iPhone. Apollo provides an excellent UX for reddit (where the native app, and their redesign fails). Apollo provides such a good UX that it was difficult to quit and keep the app on my phone for “news”.</p>\n<p>The first week was dreadful. I was in a cycle of unlocking my phone, swiping to where Apollo once was and locking it. I couldn’t hit comments on any of my news apps either. I’d say that those short, sweet comments lead to another burst of dopamine.</p>\n<p>Going in to the second week, I was reading more news, reading everything that those news sources had to offer. It was at this point, my attention span began to increase. I started sleeping easier. I wake at 0600, so getting up also became a breeze.</p>\n<p>After the third week, it became easy to just read whatever I wanted on Hacker News. My attention span was back and in full force. I noticed this elsewhere too. I spent less time multi-tasking focusing on just cooking, or what was on the TV, or speaking with my other half. Food got better, entertainment got more entertaining and my relationship improved.</p>\n<h2>Why I Came Back</h2>\n<p>I had an issue. I had mental clarity, but felt as though I was falling out of date. I had no f*cking idea what was going on in the world. To me, that’s not a huge issue, but it also brought up that I was falling out of date in the web space. My passtime, as well as my placement year at Eli Lilly, is web development. It’s why I picked the shiney Gatsby blog over some Wordpress bullshit.</p>\n<p>Again, my reason for going offline was because I didn’t want to fall behind in my career. I was also a bit bored. I had to come back. I am back. It doesn’t feel like a waste though. It was a good experience. I fixed a lot of my issues with my mind. </p>\n<p>Since I started this article, I’ve gone full overstimulation mode again. This marks the end of that. Going totally away from Reddit and discussion on HN/Lobsters just left me bored. This next iteration, or sprint, marks the self-control chapter. </p>\n<p>My goals for this sprint are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Keep Apollo on my phone, staying away from /r/all</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently, I sit with an average of 7 hours of screen-time a week. I want to see this go down to 4</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Keep up to date with current affairs</li>\n<li>Keep up to date with the latest in web</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keep on exploring my hobbies</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Release Blog V2</li>\n<li>Release my second Express clone</li>\n<li>Learn more about WebRTC; implement some distributed datastore (please don’t be <a href=\"https://github.com/hjfitz/pow-and-pos-blockchain\">another blockchain</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/productivity/","/tags/lifestyle/"],"slug":"/posts/unplugged/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Unplugged","tags":["Productivity","Lifestyle"],"date":"2019-12-06T20:35:00.000Z","description":"I went offline, unplugged, ghosted.
